+ Project summary: In this project, we have constructed a Generative Adversarial Networks and trained on over 10K faces. We have also wanted to construct a Cycle-Consistent GANs using VGGFace2 dataset, but due to limited time, we have use a pretrained model from Shaoan Lu's [repo](https://github.com/shaoanlu/fewshot-face-translation-GAN) to demonstrate some results.
